Course webpage for the NYU Spring 2021 Course: Introduction to Computer Vision. This course is aims to cover a broad topics in computer vision, and is *not* primarily a deep learning course. We will covert topics in traditional computer vision such as camera geometry, image formation, segmentation, object recognition, classification, and detection (see [Syllabus](#Syllabus)).

Special Topics in Data Science, DS-GA 3001.004/.005

### Logistics

* DS-GA 3001.004 (Lecture) \
Wednesdays 1pm-2:40pm  \
**Location**: Global Center for Academic & Spiritual Life, 238 Thompson Street (GCASL 461)   \
**Zoom Link**: please log in to NYU classes to get a meeting ID \
\
Please join the lecture in person or on Zoom. Slides will be available after the class. (see [Schedule](#Schedule)).

* DS-GA 3001.005 (Lab) \
Thursdays from 12pm-12:50pm \
**Location**: Silver Center for Arts & Science, 100 Washington Sq East (SILV_101A) \
